# Line-Follower-Robot
Implemented a line follower robot using Arduino Uno and Machine learning (Reinforcement Algorithm).
The Source code for a normal Line follower Robot is provided as well as the source code with machine learning algorithm. A proteus simulation was also created which is (Line follower.pdsprj)
